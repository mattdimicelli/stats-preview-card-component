## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- TailWind CSS
- Webpack
- NPM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was my first time ever working with Tailwind CSS.  Tailwind was installed via NPM along with Webpack and other dependencies.  I learned how to setup Webpack to include Tailwind into the build, and I also configured other webpack options such as the Webpack DevServer.  Besides practicing the use of the utility classes which Tailwind provides, I modified the config file to include my own custom classes and options.

Also of note is that I learned how to apply an accent color to an image.  Although I might have not replicated the contrast 100%, that is something that I could learn to perfect in the future.

Finally, since the built version of this webpage was in the dist folder, I had to learn how to push to a Git subtree so that GH pages would be able to publish the webpage.
